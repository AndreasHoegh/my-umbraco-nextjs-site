# Next.js + Umbraco Headless CMS Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Next.js with Umbraco as a Headless CMS. The setup allows you to manage content in Umbraco and render it dynamically in a Next.js frontend. In this repository, you will see how a Next.js app fetches content from Umbraco's Delivery API and displays it in a dynamic and responsive website.

## Features
- **Headless CMS**: Umbraco manages content, while Next.js handles the frontend.
- **API Integration**: The Next.js app communicates with Umbraco via its Headless Delivery API to display content.

## Screenshots
I will include screenshots showing the Umbraco node configuration and how the corresponding content is displayed on the website. These will illustrate how the content structure in Umbraco matches the frontend display in Next.js.
